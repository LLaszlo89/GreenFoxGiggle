        <p>Only God can judge me (that right?)
        Only God, baby (can judge me now)
        Nobody else (nobody else)
        All you other motherfuckers get out my business (really)
        (Only God can judge me now)</p></div>
      <div class="text two"><p>Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
        I couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch of dirty rats
        Will I, succeed, paranoid from the weed
        And hocus pocus I try to focus but I can't see
        And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
        Look to my future 'cause my past, is all behind me </p></div>
      <div class="text three"><p>Is it a crime, to fight, for what is mine?
        Everybody's dyin' tell me what's the use of tryin'
        I've been Trapped since birth, cautious, 'cause I'm cursed
        And fantasies of my family, in a hearse
        And they say it's the white man I should fear
        But, it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here</p></div>
