<div id="content">
  <p>Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
    I couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch of dirty rats
    Will I, succeed, paranoid from the weed
    And hocus pocus I try to focus but I can't see
    And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
    Look to my future 'cause my past, is all behind me
    Is it a crime, to fight, for what is mine?
    Everybody's dyin' tell me what's the use of tryin'
    I've been Trapped since birth, cautious, 'cause I'm cursed
    And fantasies of my family, in a hearse
    And they say it's the white man I should fear
    But, it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
    I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
    Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
    Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
    Everybody's droppin' got me knockin' on heaven's door
    And all my memories, of seein' brothers bleed
    And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
    Recollect your thoughts don't get caught up in the mix
    'Cause the media is full of dirty tricks
    Only God can judge me</p>
